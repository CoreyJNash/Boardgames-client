WDI-PVD-03 PROJECT #2 - FRONT END CLIENT BOARDGAMES SITE
==========================================================

OVERVIEW:
---------

For my second project there were 2 parts, the front end client and back end RAILS API server.  This README is for the Front end Client for the board Game Catalog.  I needed to create the front end HTML/CSS plus Javascript functions for signing-up/in/out and chang password, as well as Javascript functions for Creating/Viewing/Deleting/Updating BoardGames on the server. 

USER STORIES:
----------------
- A user can sign up and sign into the site as an authenticated user.
- A user can create a new board game to put into the catalog 
- A user can update their games by putting in the ID of the game they wish to change 
- A uer can see all the games in the catalog
- A user can delete a game in the catalog

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------
- site must be deployed to Heroku
- useres must be able to sign in/out/up and change passwood
- users must be able to Create/view/update/delete games

TECH USED:
----------
- HTML/CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- AJAX
- JQUERY
- API CONECTIVITY

HTML/CSS was used to create the framework for the site along with the styling.  I wanted to go for a minimal but simple to use design that was intuitive and pleasing for a user to look at and navigate through.

WHATS LEFT:
-----------
I would like to add a feature that a user can request to borrow a game.
I would also like to add some more styling with cool gaming Icons that could be used as the buttons in the future.
